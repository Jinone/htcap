## HTCAP

Htcap is a web application scanner able to crawl single page application (SPA) in a recursive manner by intercepting ajax calls and DOM changes.
Htcap is not just another vulnerability scanner since it's focused on the crawling process and it's aimed to detect and intercept ajax/fetch calls, websockets, jsonp ecc. It uses its own fuzzers plus a set of external tools to discover vulnerabilities and it's designed to be a tool for both manual and automated penetration test of modern web applications.

It also features a small but powerful framework to quickly develop custom fuzzers with less than 60 lines of python.
The fuzzers can work with GET/POST data, XML and JSON payloads and switch between POST and GET. Of course, fuzzers run in parallel in a multi-threaded environment.

This is the very first release that uses headless chrome instead of phantomjs.
Htcapâ€™s Javascript crawling engine has been rewritten to take advantage of the new async/await features of ecmascript and has been converted to a nodjes module build on top of [Puppetteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer).

## SETUP

### Requirements

 1. Python 2.7
 2. Nodejs and npm
 3. Sqlmap (for sqlmap scanner module)
 4. Arachni (for arachni scanner module)

### Local Installation

Install the requirements and run the following:
```console
$ git clone https://github.com/fcavallarin/htcap.git htcap
$ htcap/htcap.py
```

### Docker Installation

Install Docker and run the following:
```console
$ git clone https://github.com/fcavallarin/htcap.git htcap
$ cd htcap
$ docker build -t htcap --build-arg HTCAP_VERSION=master . # replace master by the desired htcap commit hash or branch
$ mkdir htcap-out && docker run -v "$(pwd)/htcap-out/":/out/ --rm --name htcap htcap
$ docker exec -it htcap bash
$ htcap # now you can use htcap in the Docker container
```

You can access services listening on the Docker host from within the Docker container using the hostname `host.docker.internal`.
To get the IP for `host.docker.internal`, run the following command inside the Docker container:
```console
getent hosts host.docker.internal | awk '{print $1;}'
```
